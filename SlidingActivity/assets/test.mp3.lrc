[00:02.82]You...
[00:05.18]about...
[00:08.67]first...
[00:15.31]...
[00:36.41]Now...
[00:41.90]MAN: And here on Radio Rivenden we have Lynne Rawley, 
[00:45.50]the Public Relations Officer of our own Rivenden City Theatre. Hello, Lynne.
[00:50.54]LYNNE: Hello.
[00:52.38]MAN: Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment program,isn't it?
[00:56.73]LYNNE: That's right, and there are a lot of improvements. 
[00:58.85]The first thing people will see when they go in 
[01:01.91]is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold. 
[01:05.73]Then the box office has been reoriented 
[01:08.25]with its own access form the side of the building instead of through the foyer,
[01:12.10]which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too. 
[01:16.66]The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs, 
[01:20.47]is the one part of the redevelopment which isn't yet complete. 
[01:24.60]The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre, 
[01:28.06]and we've had difficulty finding somewhere suitable. 
[01:30.51]We hope to reopen the shop in the next few months.
[01:33.73]MAN: Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?
[01:37.39]LYNNE: Yes, we've increased the leg-room between the rows. 
[01:41.13]This means that there are now fewer seats but we're sure audiences will be much happier. 
[01:45.96]And we've installed air conditioning, so it won't get so hot and stuffy. 
[01:50.34]We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users, 
[01:53.89]and now there are twice as many, which we hope will meet demand. 
[01:57.55]Something else that will benefit audiences is the new lifts. 
[02:01.26]The two we used to have were small and slow. 
[02:04.13]They've now gone, and we've got much more efficient ones.
[02:07.69]MAN: Anything for the performers?
[02:09.55]LYNNE: Yes, we've made a number of improvements backstage. 
[02:12.87]The small dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms, 
[02:18.61]so they're much more comfortable now. 
[02:20.68]And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.
[02:27.02]
[02:28.94]...
[02:50.15]Now...
[02:57.61]MAN: OK, so what's the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?
[03:03.52]LYNNE: We've got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer's Royal Hunt of the Sun, 
[03:07.69]which is currently touring the country. 
[03:09.40]That starts on October the 13th and runs till the 19th. 
[03:13.42]We're experimenting bit with the time the curtain goes up. 
[03:16.57]We used to start all our performances at 7.30, 
[03:19.47]but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport, 
[03:23.04]so instead we're beginning at 7. 
[03:25.49]Because at 9.45, when it finished, there are still buses running. 
[03:30.31]Tickets are already selling fast. 
[03:32.20]The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately and, 
[03:35.97]now there are only tickets for Monday and Thursday.
[03:39.12]MAN: How much are they?
[03:40.30]LYNNE: We've introduced a simpler price structure. 
[03:43.12]Ticket prices used to range from 6 pounds to 30 pounds but now they're all 18 pounds. 
[03:49.58]They're available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online
[03:55.47]MAN: OK, Lynne, now if you'd like to give the contact details for the theatre.
[04:00.09]
[04:39.97]Now turn to section 3.
